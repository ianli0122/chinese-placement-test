- Time out user sessions
    - change internal variable "id" to "session"
    - make user sessions save when they answer a question
- Password integration
    - create password from student_id?

- we can change the system to be more password-friendly by creating some new files
    - students.json can just be a json array of ids, these will be the only allowed ids for login
    - student_data.json can be for storing student data (theta, whether they have taken the test, etc)
        - when we start the program, we will need to make sure that data for each student id exists. if not, we will have to generate some blank data for each student
        - this can be a dict of ids to more dicts
        - these "subdicts" can store theta, questions, question responses (correct or not), whether or not they have completed the test, etc
    - we will then need to probably update instances.py, and/or make a new python file to easily manage sessions and students
        - this will be thought out more later
    - for login, we have the user input their id and password
        - password is obtained through taking the id, adding "SALT" .env variable
        - "SALT" is just some random string, anything works
        - we then concat str(id) and the salt, then hash, then feed that hash into something that can create a good unique password
        - we can figure out a password from there
        - we can also make something that exports a csv file of ids and passwords

- Add admin view
    - admin password can be stored in .env file ("ADMIN_PASSWORD")
    - make admin view export csv file instead of writing to it in program, so we can change the internal data file to json

- Website hosting
- Testing bank
    - Implement testing bank
    - Test bank calibration
- Nicer UI (maybe animations?)
